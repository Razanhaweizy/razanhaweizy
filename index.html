        <h4>Hi! My name is Razan Haweizy.</h4>
        <p>I'm currently studying at Brown University and I'm from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. I'm interested in software engineering, fullstack development, and data analysis! I'm also into mathematics :) In my free time, I enjoy video games, crocheting, writing, and I occasionally indulge in an unserious game of basketball! I currently serve as the vice president of diversty, equity, and inclusion in the Alpha Epsilon chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta. I'm part of the Women in Computer Science society. And I love cats.</p>
        <p>I'm eager to to contribute my skills and passion for mathematics and computer science and apply the intersections between the two. I have always enjoyed solving complex problems and puzzles as I enjoy the challenge, and some of my favorite classes I have taken are data structures and algorithms, multivariable calculus, and ordinary differential equations. I am proficient in Python, Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, and I am adept at using these programming languages to develop efficient and scalable solutions to problems. Lastly, I am highly motivated by challenges and enjoy collaborative environments in which I have the opportunity to work with teammates to deliver high-quality outcomes!</p>

    <div class="projectlayout">
        <p>In addition to my classes, I have built and implemented projects in those classes that have taught me in depth about not only time and space efficiency, but also the intricacies of data structures and good program design. Here are some of my favorite in-class projects that I have done and thoroughly enjoyed!</p>
        <div class="classprojects">
            <div class="classproject">
                <h4>Sharing Information</h4>
                <p>This project is a messaging system that stores messages in text files with metadata for efficient management. I implemented features for handling storage, automatic deletion of outdated messages, and merging files when needed to optimize performance. The system ensures that messages are organized and accessible while maintaining scalability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="classproject">
                <h4>Decision Tree</h4>
                <p>This was a group project that I collaborated on. I developed a decision tree model to assist with decision-making processes by evaluating various input attributes. The project focused on using decision trees to structure and analyze data, making predictions based on multiple factors. I implemented data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques to ensure the modelâ€™s accuracy and adaptability across diverse scenarios.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="classproject">
                <h4>GraphQuest</h4>
                <p>This project explores graph data structures and their practical applications. I implemented a new graph representation, EdgeArrayGraph, that adheres to a generic interface. Additionally, I applied breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest paths between nodes and planned for using graphs to manage schedule conflicts. The project emphasizes both conceptual understanding and effective testing strategies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="classproject">
                <h4>Pandas</h4>
                <p>This project focused on maintaining and analyzing patient visit data at medical clinics, utilizing pandas for data manipulation. I worked on cleaning and normalizing patient information from CSV files, updating patient and visit records, and producing data visualizations to track key health metrics. Additionally, I wrote tests to ensure data accuracy and the proper functionality of data processing functions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="classproject">
                <h4>Totally Tubular Tables</h4>
                <p>For this project, I analyzed the density of grocery and convenience stores in various counties across the USA. I worked with multiple datasets to calculate statistics such as the variability of stores across counties and the relationship between population size and store density. I also implemented a summary-generator function that takes in data and computes flexible statistics like the mean or total for different store categories, helping to answer key analysis questions with the datasets provided.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="classproject">
                <h4>Frog Maze Craze</h4>
                <p>In this partner project, I developed a maze game where the player controls a frog navigating through a maze of water and grass tiles. The bee collects widgets that affect stamina or portals that allow teleportation, while avoiding running out of stamina or getting stuck. I implemented the game logic using recursion, datatypes, and a reactor model, and used spreadsheets to configure the maze layout and item placements, creating an interactive and engaging gameplay experience.</p>
